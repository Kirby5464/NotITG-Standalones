# Introduction
This repository is a collection of simfiles or levels I made for the community-driven rhythm game based on StepMania, NotITG. This repository does not include the files I made in collaboration with other people or files made in jams, or rushes.

## Installation
1. Get NotITG from https://www.noti.tg/.
2. Put the "Kirby5464" folder into the Songs folder after the game is extracted.
3. Launch NotITG in the Programs folder.
